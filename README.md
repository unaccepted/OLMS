# OLMS Online Library Management System

# Why Online Library Management System is necessary ?

This is  extremely beneficial in regards to saving time spent in manually searching, requesting and issuing books.  

Also managing the records of the multiple copies of various books in the library can become very tedious if not automated.  

OLMS aims to automate library management with two end users, administrator and library members.  

Issue of library membership, adding or removing books and issue of books is taken into account.  

The members may be added or deleted at the discretion of the admin.  

The admin may add, amend or delete books as well as book categories.  

The library member will be able to perform all sorts of operation like searching for books, send book issue request, send return book request and display the book issue/return status.

# Future Scope  

There is no due date for the issued books. This feature may be implemented and extended to include the concept of late fee.  

The user can view books only when the user is registered into the system and approved by the admin. A "guest user" feature may be added; guest users will be able to search for books without logging in.  

A book may belong to only one category. This feature can be implemented, but due to time restrictions, it remains an unimplemented feature in the current project.  

The Admin cannot issue books from the library. The Admin may be given library member privileges in the future.
